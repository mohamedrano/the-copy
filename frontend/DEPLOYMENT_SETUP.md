# 🚀 Deployment Setup Complete

## ✅ Implementation Summary

The CI/CD pipeline has been successfully configured with all required features and quality gates.

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Created `.env.example` with all required variables
- ✅ Implemented Zod validation to prevent server secrets leaking to client
- ✅ Environment-based API key selection (main → PROD, others → STAGING)

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)

#### Quality Gates
- ✅ Node 20 with `npm ci` for reproducible builds
- ✅ TypeScript type checking
- ✅ ESLint linting
- ✅ Unit tests with Vitest
- ✅ **Coverage threshold ≥ 80%** (enforced)
- ✅ **Bundle size check < 250KB compressed** for first page
- ✅ E2E tests with Playwright on production build
- ✅ **E2E success rate ≥ 95%** (enforced)

#### Deployment Features
- ✅ Firebase Hosting with preview channels for PRs
- ✅ Auto-deploy to live channel on main branch
- ✅ Sentry sourcemap upload with release = commit SHA
- ✅ Sentry release creation
- ✅ Automatic PR comments with preview URLs

#### Monitoring & Reports
- ✅ Web Vitals tracking and reporting (LCP, FCP, CLS, FID, TTFB)
- ✅ Bundle analysis artifacts
- ✅ Coverage reports
- ✅ E2E test results with traces
- ✅ Performance reports

## 🎯 Standard Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server

# Quality Checks
npm run lint             # Lint code
npm run typecheck        # Check types
npm run build            # Production build

# Testing
npm run test             # Unit tests (vitest)
npm run e2e              # E2E tests (playwright)

# Analysis
npm run analyze          # Bundle analysis
```

## 🔄 Deployment Flow

### For Main Branch (Production)
1. Push to `main` triggers pipeline
2. Runs all quality checks (coverage, E2E, bundle size)
3. Builds production-optimized bundle
4. Uploads sourcemaps to Sentry with SHA release
5. Deploys to Firebase live channel
6. Creates Sentry release
7. Generates deployment summary

### For Feature Branches / PRs
1. Create PR triggers pipeline
2. Runs all quality checks
3. Builds with staging API key
4. Creates Firebase preview channel
5. Comments on PR with preview URL
6. Preview expires after 30 days

## 📈 First Run Checklist

Before pushing to main:

1. ✅ Configure all GitHub secrets
2. ✅ Verify Firebase project exists
3. ✅ Verify Sentry project exists
4. ⏳ Push to main branch
5. ⏳ Wait for pipeline completion
6. ⏳ Verify deployment success

## 🎉 Expected First Run Output

After the first successful run on main, you will have:

1. **Live Deployment URL**: Your Firebase hosting live URL
2. **Bundle Report**: Available in GitHub Actions artifacts
3. **Web Vitals Summary**: In performance report artifact
4. **Coverage Report**: Showing ≥80% coverage
5. **E2E Results**: Showing ≥95% success rate
6. **Sentry Release**: With sourcemaps for error tracking

## 📚 Additional Documentation

- Pipeline details: `.github/workflows/README.md`
- Environment variables: `.env.example`
- Testing guidelines: `TESTING_GUIDELINES.md`

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check GitHub Actions logs for specific error
- Verify all secrets are configured correctly
- Ensure coverage meets 80% threshold
- Check bundle size isn't exceeding limits

### Deployment Fails
- Verify `FIREBASE_TOKEN` has correct permissions
- Check `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` matches your project
- Ensure Firebase Hosting is enabled

### Monitoring Issues
- Verify Sentry secrets are correct
- Check Sentry organization has project access
- Ensure sourcemap upload permissions

## 🚦 Next Steps

1. **Configure GitHub Secrets** - Add all required secrets to your repository
2. **Push to Main** - Trigger the first production deployment
3. **Monitor Results** - Check GitHub Actions for pipeline status
4. **Verify Deployment** - Test the live URL
5. **Check Reports** - Download and review artifacts
